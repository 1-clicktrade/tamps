OF 2025

ETF INNOVATORS

A lot of advisors I talk to are hungry
for fresh ideas. Suddenly, after a
decade of relative calm, we have
problems worth solving.
Whatever broke in the last few years
needs to be fixed. And as part of that
process, every component of the
portfolio needs to be tested, refined
and, where necessary, replaced.
It’s a daunting task. But there’s help.
Money managers didn’t spend the
last decade asleep and dreaming of
index funds. They kept innovating.
Pushing the science
You just won’t find a lot of these
fresh ideas on standard fund
screens. They’re under the surface,
submerged in the status quo of
literally thousands of look-alike
index products with copycat
characteristics and “me too”
attitude.
That’s why I talked to managers,
strategists and advisor liaisons
at established ETF companies
and upstarts alike, to get those
ideas in front of you and into your
professional tool kit. If you’ve got a
problem, there’s got to be something
here that helps.

Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have become a staple
in the portfolios of investors worldwide, offering a
versatile, cost-effective way to access a broad spectrum
of assets. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or a
novice just starting out, the ever-evolving landscape of
ETFs presents both opportunities and challenges that
can significantly impact your investment strategy.
In recent years, the world of ETFs
has seen rapid innovation, with active
ETFs gaining traction alongside the
more traditional passive options.

preference; it’s a strategic decision
that hinges on factors such as cost
efficiency, performance potential, and
transparency.

Active ETFs are projected to account
for 24% of total fund assets by 2027,
representing about $14 trillion globally.
The rise of active ETFs has been fueled
by regulatory changes, such as the
Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) Rule 6c-11, which allows new
structures and greater flexibility for fund
managers. It has opened the door for
more sophisticated, actively managed
strategies that aim to outperform
the market—a stark contrast to the
passive ETFs that simply aim to mirror
the performance of a specific index or
benchmark. As a result, investors now
face a key decision: should they stick
with the tried-and-true approach of
passive ETFs or explore the potentially
higher returns—and higher risks—
active ETFs offer?

Beyond the active vs. passive debate,
the ETF market has also been
shaped by the need for continuous
innovation. In today’s complex
investment environment, simply relying
on traditional strategies may not be
enough. The efficient frontier—the
sweet spot where risk and return are
optimized—is constantly shifting, and
investors must adapt their strategies
accordingly. This guide will help you
navigate these changes, offering
insights into the trade-offs between
different types of ETFs and how to
position your portfolio for success
in this dynamic landscape. Whether
you’re looking to stick with the
simplicity of passive ETFs or explore
the cutting-edge strategies that active
management offers, understanding
the current ETF environment is crucial
to making informed investment
decisions.

The choice between active and passive
ETFs is more than just a matter of

2025 THE TOP ETF INNOVATORS
ACTIVE VS. PASSIVE ETFs:
WHAT’S THE TRADE-OFF?
ETFs have undergone a notable
transformation in recent years,
particularly with the rise of active
ETFs. The shift has opened new
avenues for investors seeking marketbeating returns while retaining the
benefits of an ETF structure. Still,
when it comes to choosing between
active and passive ETFs, investors
often face a key trade-off: the
potential for outperformance versus
cost efficiency and simplicity. To
understand the trade-offs between
active and passive ETFs, it’s essential
to delve into their key characteristics,
market trends, and the implications for
investors.
Active ETFs have emerged as a
prominent trend, driven by regulatory
changes and a growing appetite for
active management strategies, thanks
in part to the SEC’s Rule 6c-11, which
took effect in December 2019. The
rule, allowing for non-transparent and
semi-transparent ETF structures, has
empowered managers with greater
flexibility in portfolio management
while protecting their holdings. While
the rule applies to both passive and
active open-ended funds, several key
changes have addressed previous
limitations on active ETFs and created
a more favorable environment for
active management.
Key provisions of the rule include:
1. Custom Basket Flexibility: The
rule permits ETFs to use custom
baskets, enhancing portfolio
management, tax efficiency, and
the ability to accommodate inkind creations and redemptions.
2. Simplified Approval Process:
The rule standardizes the
approval process for ETFs,
reducing the need for individual
exemptive relief applications and
making it easier for sponsors to
bring new ETFs to market.
3. Enhanced Transparency: ETFs
must now disclose daily portfolio
holdings on their websites,
increasing transparency for
investors.

4. Harmonized Exemptive Relief:
By eliminating the need for most
ETFs to seek individual exemptive
relief, the regulatory process has
been simplified, benefiting both
sponsors and investors.
Let’s look closer at the differences
between passive and active ETFs.
Passive ETFs are designed to replicate
the performance of a specific index
or benchmark. They are often favored
for their cost efficiency, with expense
ratios typically 2 to 3 basis points
lower than those of mutual funds. The
cost-effectiveness, combined with
high liquidity and tax advantages,
makes passive ETFs an attractive
option for many investors. They are
particularly useful for achieving broad
market exposure and are widely used
for diversified investments in stocks
and bonds.
Active ETFs, on the other hand, are
managed by fund managers who
actively select securities with the aim of

4

outperforming an index or benchmark.
These ETFs can focus on specific
themes or innovative beta strategies,
providing potential for higher returns.
However, this active management
comes with higher costs compared to
passive ETFs. Investors in active ETFs
are betting on the expertise of the fund
manager to generate alpha, or excess
returns above the benchmark.
The trade-offs with actively managed
ETFs include:
1. Cost Efficiency: Passive ETFs
generally have lower expense
ratios thanks to their automated
management approach. Active
ETFs incur higher management
fees, reflecting the cost of
research, analysis, and active
decision-making.
2. Performance Potential: While
passive ETFs aim to match
market returns, active ETFs seek
to beat them. This different focus
could lead to higher returns if

2025 THE TOP ETF INNOVATORS
the fund manager’s strategy
succeeds, but it also introduces
the risk of underperformance if
the manager’s decisions do not
pan out.
3. Transparency and Flexibility:
Passive ETFs offer straightforward
transparency by tracking an
index, whereas active ETFs
provide a more complex, but
potentially more nuanced, picture.
Rule 6c-11 has introduced a level
of semi-transparency for active
ETFs, but it may still be less
transparent than passive options.
4. Investment Strategy: Passive
ETFs are ideal for investors
seeking a low-cost, diversified
approach with predictable
outcomes. Active ETFs cater to
those looking for higher returns
through strategic management
and who are willing to accept
higher costs and risks associated
with active investing.
Globally, the trend toward cost
efficiency has bolstered the popularity
of passive ETFs. However, the rise
of active ETFs, particularly with
the new regulatory frameworks,
suggests a growing adoption of active
management strategies. The balance
between cost and performance
remains a critical consideration for
investors.
The choice between active and
passive ETFs depends on an investor’s
objectives, risk tolerance, and
preference for cost versus potential
return. While passive ETFs provide a
cost-effective, diversified approach
with lower fees, active ETFs offer the
opportunity for higher returns at the
expense of higher costs and greater
risk. As the ETF landscape continues
to evolve, understanding these tradeoffs will be crucial for making informed
investment decisions.

NECESSITY NEEDS INNOVATION
In recent years, many aspects of the
investment landscape have faced
significant challenges, and that means
every part of the portfolio must be

tested, refined, and, when necessary,
replaced. It’s a daunting task, but
there’s good news: money managers
have been diligently at work. Over the
past decade, they’ve been innovating
and rigorously testing new strategies
to address the gaps in the market and
solve real problems advisors face.
However, many of these new ideas
aren’t easily spotted on standard
fund screens—they’re often hidden
beneath the surface, overshadowed
by the vast number of similar index
products that blend into the crowd.
That’s why we reached out to managers, strategists, and advisor liaisons
at both established ETF companies
and innovative startups to bring these
ideas to the forefront and add them to
your professional tool kit.
Even if everything seems to be working just fine, there’s always room for
improvement. We continuously learn,
benchmark, innovate, and integrate
the best new ideas to stay ahead of
the curve. But before we dive into
solutions, let’s start by identifying the
problems.

THE EFFICIENT FRONTIER
HITS A WALL
In the world of investing, there’s always
a delicate balance between risk and
returns. The sweet spot is where you
achieve the highest possible return
for a given level of risk, known as the
efficient frontier—a concept rooted in
modern portfolio theory. But here’s the
catch: the efficient frontier isn’t fixed—
it’s constantly evolving as markets shift
and new challenges arise, demanding
continuous adaptation from investors.
For mass affluent and ultra-high-networth (UHNW) individuals, identifying
the right position on this evolving frontier
is vital and heavily influenced by their
unique financial situations and goals.
Here’s how this concept plays out,
especially when considering ETFs:
• Balancing Risk and Return:
Both mass affluent and UHNW
individuals want good returns
without taking on unnecessary
risk. For these investors,

OPTIONS.
positioning portfolios on the
efficient frontier involves selecting
investments that strike this
balance, offering a favorable tradeoff between risk and return.
• Diversification: ETFs are great
for spreading investments across
various asset classes, sectors,
and regions. This diversification
reduces the impact of any single
investment going wrong and helps
improve risk-adjusted returns.
For both groups, portfolios on the
efficient frontier should include
diversified ETFs.
• Cost Efficiency: ETFs generally
have lower management fees
compared to actively managed
funds. For those who prioritize
cost efficiency, selecting low-cost
ETFs that align with the efficient
frontier can significantly enhance
net returns. This cost advantage
is especially relevant for investors
looking to maximize their financial
outcomes while keeping expenses
in check.
• Liquidity: The liquidity of ETFs
allows investors to easily buy
or sell shares, offering flexibility
in portfolio management. For
individuals who require this level
of adaptability, portfolios that
feature highly liquid ETFs provide a
practical advantage.
• Customization: UHNW investors
often demand bespoke investment

2025 THE TOP ETF INNOVATORS
solutions tailored to their specific
preferences and needs. The
efficient frontier accommodates
this need by including options
for customization, such as
sector-specific or factor-based
ETFs. These tailored solutions
help UHNW individuals align
their portfolios with their unique
financial objectives.
Efficiency in investing is about making
the most of what you have to work
with, aiming for an ideal within the
boundaries of the current market
landscape. But what happens when
the standard itself changes? Traditional
strategies may falter. For example,
the simple, passive strategies that
once worked in a post-2008 era have
started to crack under pressure. Fixed
income allocations, traditionally seen
as safe havens, failed to provide the
protection investors expected when
the Federal Reserve began tightening.

Bonds, which were supposed to be
reliable, turned volatile, shaking the
confidence of many investors.
Similarly, reliance on broad market
indexes such as the S&P 500 (SPY)
is proving insufficient for today’s
investors. While these indexes offer
valuable insights, they lack the tailored
approach that modern clients demand.
Wealth management has evolved
beyond securing average returns—it
now involves helping clients achieve
specific, personalized financial goals,
whether that means seeking higher
returns or mitigating risk.
The reality is that the efficient frontier we
once knew has shifted. The models that
guided portfolio construction in the past
may no longer align with the current
market environment.
And while your clients think they
can do it on their own, they can’t.

Remember, according to DALBAR,
the average equity fund investor
underperformed the S&P 500 by 5.5%
in 2023, marking the third-largest gap
in a decade—and in a normally bullish
year at that.
The performance gap largely
resulted from emotional decisionmaking, with investors often selling
during downturns and missing out
on subsequent rebounds. Despite
optimal portfolio allocations designed
to balance risk and reward, many
investors succumbed to loss
aversion during market declines,
particularly following 2022, and missed
out on the recovery.
To continue delivering value, we
need to redefine what efficiency and
perfection mean in today’s terms. The
key is to refine strategies, embrace
innovation, and build portfolios that are
resilient to new challenges.

TOTAL COSTS OF OWNERSHIP
The overall cost of owning ETFs compared to mutual funds is
generally comparable and can vary based on factors such as
the investor’s profile, fund type, and asset class

7

TOTAL EXPENSE RATIO
ETFs typically have a lower expense ratio due to factors
such as the absence of a transfer agent, wider distribution
capabilities, and increased price visibility and competition on
exchanges
TRADING FEES
Retail investors are more likely to be impacted by additional
expenses associated with ETFs, such as trading fees,
compared to institutional investors

TAX ADVANTAGES
The US ETF market has experienced substantial growth,
partly due to the significant tax advantages that ETFs enjoy
compared to mutual funds

LIQUIDITY
ETFs offer greater liquidity compared to mutual funds because
ETFs can be traded throughout market hours, while mutual
funds only execute orders once a day

INVESTMENT MINIMUMS
ETFs generally have lower investment minimums, making
them more accessible to retail investors and providing greater
ease of access compared to other investment options.
TRANSPARENCY
ETFs offer a higher level of transparency compared to mutual
funds. ETFs typically provide daily disclosure of their holdings,
except for se-mi transparent ETFs, allowing investors to have
more frequent access to information about the underlying
securities. In contrast, mutual funds typically disclose their
holdings on a quarterly basis.
INNOVATION
Recent data suggests that the launch of new funds in the ETF
space is gaining market share, partially due to the reduced
infrastructure costs associated with introducing ETFs.
ACCESSIBILITY
ETFs offer greater accessibility to the general public compared
to mutual funds, as they are traded on exchanges and do not
require an intermediary for transactions.

THE “RANDOM WALK” NARRATIVE
WORKS WHEN YOU WANT PEOPLE TO
FORGET ABOUT THEIR CONCERN AND
DISENGAGE FROM THE PROCESS.
In a constantly changing landscape,
the pursuit of an investment ideal
is an ongoing process. Investors
and advisors must learn from past
experiences, adapt to new realities,
and ensure that their strategies remain
aligned with evolving definitions of the
efficient frontier. By staying informed and
responsive to market shifts, they can
better position their clients for success,
regardless of how the landscape of
investing evolves.

BEYOND THE RANDOM WALK
The allure of passive strategies such as
those involving the S&P 500 and similar
index funds can be strong. They offer
the comfort of a familiar, well-trodden
path that leads the way. But what if
your clients are seeking something
beyond the standard route?
The investing landscape has shifted
significantly since the days when
Burton Malkiel’s “random walk” theory
suggested that passive investing
was the best way to go. Malkiel’s
theory argues that stock prices
move unpredictably and it’s nearly
impossible to consistently outperform
the market through stock picking, so
holding a diversified portfolio may be
most beneficial long term. However,
the theory may not hold as strongly
today due to increased market
complexity, information asymmetries,
and the significant influence of a few
dominant technology companies,
which can skew traditional riskreturn assumptions and diminish the
effectiveness of passive strategies.
The concentration of big tech
dominating the market, often referred
to as the “Magnificent Seven,” makes
proper diversification tricky, especially if
your clients are already heavily invested
in these tech magnates. The handful

of high-volatility giants can distort the
risk-return balance that once made
the S&P 500 so appealing. Although
these stocks have performed well
and earned their place at the top,
as they grow, the index becomes
more concentrated, and with that
concentration comes increased
volatility, which makes it harder to
mitigate risk when things go awry.
In response to these changes, many
investment managers are exploring
more active strategies to enhance their
clients’ portfolios. Instead of completely
overhauling the S&P 500, some
managers are reweighting portfolios to
increase cash yield, which might only
provide a 1% advantage but can have a
meaningful impact. This strategy could
help cover fees, offset low bond yields,
or even assist with required minimum
distributions, offering a smoother
investment experience in turbulent times.
Other managers are revisiting
traditional stock-picking techniques,
focusing on quality over sheer
market size. This approach aligns
with the belief that successful wealth
management involves more than
just tracking the market—it requires
making informed, research-driven
decisions that add value over time.
By selecting high-quality stocks and
fostering a deeper connection between
investors and their investments,
advisors can offer a more personalized
and engaging experience. Clients
often want to feel a connection to
the companies they invest in, rather
than just owning a slice of the market.
Advisors can guide them on this
journey and explain the story behind
their investments.
While passive investing offers a
straightforward approach, the evolving
market landscape suggests that a more

7

nuanced strategy might be necessary.
By integrating active management
and exploring alternative theories,
advisors can provide clients with more
personalized, engaging investment
experiences, potentially uncovering
unique opportunities beyond the
traditional index fund route.

STORY FUNDS: NEW
THEMES, OLD FAITH
While tweaking the core of a portfolio
can add some stability or boost
returns, the real magic happens on the
edges and beyond the numbers, where
you can connect with your clients by
telling them the stories behind their
investments.
Sometimes, these narratives are purely
economic, where you generate alpha
and improve your client’s financial
position, and there’s no shortage of
thematic funds that cater to almost
every narrative you can imagine.
However, economic gains aren’t the
only aspect of client satisfaction.
The power of thematic investing lies
in aligning investments with clients’
interests and values to enhance their
engagement. Find out what your
clients are passionate about and
get them involved. It’s not just about
making money—it’s about making
them feel connected to what their
money is being invested in.
“Disruption” funds rely heavily on
the manager’s ability to predict
future trends accurately. Investing in
innovative technologies, businesses,
and emerging industries that may
challenge the status quo embodies
classic active management: aiming to
outperform the market by anticipating
where it’s heading. In an era dominated
by passive index funds, investing in
unique disruption funds may offer
valuable diversification benefits.
Then there are more specialized
thematic funds, which focus on niche
interests that may not be covered by
traditional-broad market funds. While
some have been criticized for chasing
trends, there’s a renewed emphasis on
integrating them into portfolios to meet
specific investment goals and engage
clients with emerging technologies and
industries.

2025 THE TOP ETF INNOVATORS
Similarly, high-impact bets in
specialized and thematic areas can
be more volatile, leading to significant
gains or losses. However, when
successful, they can be transformative
and make clients feel more connected
to their investments. The ones that
don’t pan out aren’t large enough to
cause significant damage, but the
ones that do can be game-changers.
And when they succeed, your clients
won’t just see them as investments—
they’ll see them as victories.
While adjustments to the core of
a portfolio can offer stability and
potential gains, the true value often
lies in the more individualized and
innovative aspects of investing—
where stories and personal
connections elevate the investment
experience. Thematic funds, whether
driven by economic gains or personal
values, offer a chance to deeply
engage clients by aligning their
investments with their passions and
interests.

ALL THE FLAVORS IN THE
MODERN MARKET
What have we learned so far? You can
reach for better outcomes than the
random walk. It’s possible. Over time,
that’s worth something.
And this is essential after “business
as usual” hits a wall and reveals its
limitations. We learn. We evolve.
“Modern” portfolio theory is now 70
years old. It has been refined a lot along
the way and keeps getting better.
After all, the last decade wasn’t all
about consolidating popular ideas into
gigantic fund complexes. The world
has changed a lot.
Whole asset classes emerged out of
nowhere. Others got the technological
and regulatory lift they needed to make
the leap from institutional environments
to the ETF format.
Think private equity and private debt.
Think derivatives. Think pure hedge
fund: all of the return characteristics,
no complicated structure or qualified
investor hurdles to jump.

EVALUATING A FUND
There’s more to life than performance.
Even with funds that ostensibly
mirror the same index, you need to
be conscious of “tracking error” and
“tracking difference.”

Assess the total cost of ETF
ownership, comprising transaction
costs and annual management fees.
Beyond immediate costs, consider
potential taxes and associated risks to
determine the actual total cost.

Tracking difference measures how
closely the ETF tracks the index
returns, while tracking error indicates
the consistency of monitoring quality
over time. Both metrics are equally
important for determining the ETF’s
ability to mirror its index accurately.

Different types of ETFs entail varying
levels of risk. ETFs holding foreign
securities are subject to exchange
rate movements, while those investing
in bonds are sensitive to interest
rate fluctuations. ETFs focused on
emerging markets and commodities
may face extreme market conditions.

Additionally, the choice of ETF provider
is significant in performance evaluation.
With a plethora of ETF providers in the
market, factors such as size, scale,
expertise, and commitment vary widely.
Trust in the provider’s technology
capabilities to manage costs and risks
efficiently is vital.
Understanding the underlying index
is also essential. ETFs closely follow
specific indexes or sectors. Indexes
employ varying selection rules for their
holdings, so selecting the correct index
is crucial.
Consider your client’s investment
objectives when choosing an ETF. Do
they actively seek exposure to countryspecific, regional, or global assets?
Which sectors or asset classes are
they interested in? This consideration
helps tailor your ETF selection to align
with their investment goals.
ETFs have two primary structures:
physical and synthetic. Physical ETFs
hold the underlying assets of the index,
while synthetic ETFs use derivatives
to replicate index performance.
Each structure has advantages and
disadvantages, impacting risk levels
and management costs.
Understanding the trading mechanics
of ETFs is crucial. ETFs, like stocks,
can be traded throughout the trading
hours of the exchange, enhancing
liquidity compared to managed funds.
Awareness of trading times and
liquidity layers is essential for practical
trading strategies.

8

In summary, prioritize performance
evaluation, index selection, and ETF
structure alignment with your client’s
investment objectives. Assess total
costs comprehensively and choose a
reputable ETF provider with the right
technology and track record.

Advisors’ fiduciary duty when choosing
an ETF: The primary fiduciary law governing financial advisors in the United
States is the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act (ERISA) of 1974.
Under ERISA, financial advisors who
are considered fiduciaries must adhere
to the fundamental principles of duty of
loyalty, duty of prudence, duty of diversification, and duty of disclosure.
In addition to ERISA, the SEC has
introduced regulations to establish
a fiduciary duty for financial advisors
who provide investment advice to retail
clients. The SEC’s Regulation Best
Interest (Reg B.I.), implemented in
2020, requires brokers and investment
advisors to act in the best interests
of their retail clients when making
investment recommendations.

How advisors pick a fund: Below is a
non-exhaustive list of some specific
obligations that an advisor has when
choosing an ETF for a client.
Suitability: The advisor must ensure
that the chosen ETF is suitable for
the client’s investment objectives,
risk tolerance, time horizon, financial
situation, and any other relevant factors.
Due diligence: The advisor has a
responsibility to conduct thorough
research and due diligence on their

2025 THE TOP ETF INNOVATORS
recommendations, including analyzing
the ETF’s investment strategy,
performance track record, expense
ratio, underlying assets, and provider’s
reputation and track record.

•

Disclosure of risks and fees: The
advisor must provide clear and
accurate information about the risks
associated with investing in the ETF—
including market risks, liquidity risks,
and any specific risks related to the
ETF’s investment strategy or underlying
assets—and disclose all fees and
expenses associated with the ETF.

When considering these changes,
advisors must weigh the costs of
transactions, potential tax implications,
and the impact on the overall investment
strategy to ensure the portfolio remains
aligned with the client’s goals, risk
tolerance, and investment horizon.

Monitoring and review: Once an ETF is
selected, the advisor has an ongoing
obligation to monitor the performance
and suitability of the investment.

Tax considerations
Liquidity concerns
Divergence from investment thesis

The suitability question: When selecting an ETF or creating a sleeve
for ETFs, several considerations can

impact the best choice to meet client’s
investment goals and risk tolerance.
Advisors should:
• Define investment objectives
• Assess risk tolerance
• Determine the asset allocation
• Evaluate diversification
• Research ETFs
• Analyze holdings
• Integrate tracking error
• Gauge liquidity
• Analyze tax efficiency
• Evaluate performance
• Consider costs
• Review fund providers
• Determine suitability and fit

MAKE ROOM FOR INNOVATION

Conflict of interest disclosure: If
the advisor or their firm receives
compensation or incentives for
recommending a particular ETF, they
must disclose these conflicts of interest
to the client and ensure that their
recommendations are based on the
client’s best interests.

1. Does this ETF improve on an existing holding?

How to pick a fund for your client:
There is no specific formula for selecting a client portfolio’s “correct” ETFs.
However, financial advisors typically follow a systematic approach. In addition
to the client’s investment objectives,
risk tolerance, and overall investment
style and strategy, key factors that help
ensure suitability include:
• Asset allocation
• Index or strategy selection
• Expense ratio and fees
• Liquidity and trading volume
• Provider and reputation
• Market conditions and outlook
• Investment style and strategy
• Client preferences and restrictions
• Performance and historical data

Once you’ve found a fund that performs a particular investment function
better than something in your client’s portfolio, it’s time to make a switch.

When an old fund isn’t working: An advisor might consider selling or replacing one or more ETFs to, for example,
optimize the portfolio’s performance,
adjust the risk profile, or respond to
changing market or economic conditions. The advisor will consider:
• Performance reassessment
• Asset allocation adjustment
• Sector or theme rotation

2. Does this ETF enhance my portfolio?
Answers to these questions are often personal. They depend on your client’s
immediate and long-term priorities and goals. Maybe they need current
income. Maybe they’re looking for a long-term payoff and are willing to
tolerate years or even decades of frustration.

If you’re 100% convinced that the new solution is superior, sell out of the old
position and replace it with the new one.
Otherwise, rotate out of the old and into the new on an incremental basis
to give the new holding a chance to verify that it provides an enhanced
experience.
And when you are unhappy with a given allocation, that’s an incentive to look
harder for a replacement. You might need to pay higher fees for higher returns,
a smoother glide path or some other benefit. That’s how this goes.
At a minimum, everything in the portfolio needs to be competitive according
to whatever criteria matter to you. If fees matter, go for a low-cost provider
that can at least match the category benchmark. If performance matters, look
for alpha and be prepared to pay the price. Correlation and volatility (or the
lack thereof) can also be important factors.
Keep in mind that some ETFs do not fit into the standard asset class scheme.
“Modern” portfolio needs to keep evolving or it rapidly becomes obsolete.
A fund may blur conventional allocation lines: maybe it’s an “alternative”
investment or a new approach to standard stocks, bonds or even cash.
When there isn’t an existing sleeve in the portfolio to open up to something
good, maybe it’s time to take a few percentage points from other allocations
to make it happen.

2025 THE TOP ETF INNOVATORS
THE TACTICAL FRONTIER
You don’t need to travel to exotic
places to find places where innovation
makes a difference. Even asset
management complexes that once
distributed their ideas only through
managed accounts and proprietary
fund placements are now opening up
to the exchange-traded mind-set.
When it comes to innovation in
investing, you don’t need to look far to
find cutting-edge strategies. Even firms
that once reserved their best strategies
for managed accounts or proprietary
funds are now embracing ETFs.
Advisors can now tap into exclusive
strategies from top-tier names like
DFA, AllianceBernstein, and Goldman
Sachs—without compromising on
diversification or performance. In fact,
traditional mutual funds may actually
lag behind in terms of fee efficiency
and tax treatment.
These firms have spent years
perfecting world-class trading and
portfolio construction systems to
squeeze out every bit of alpha. Now,
they’re packaging those strategies in
ETFs that are accessible to any advisor.
The once-elite insights from Wall
Street’s top banks are now available
on the open market, giving everyone a
chance to benefit. And these firms are
constantly innovating, introducing new
core strategies designed to challenge
even the NASDAQ.
Proprietary traders, for example, are
layering options around indexes to
generate current income. These are
brand new strategies, and being early
to the game can give your clients a
significant advantage. The level of
sophistication involved means that
while you might be able to manage it
yourself, you probably wouldn’t want
to—leaving you free to focus on other
areas where you can add value.
For those who cling to the “hold
forever” mind-set, it’s worth reminding
them that there are always new
opportunities to explore. You can help
your clients move beyond the standard
“random walk” approach and show
them something different, something

CASTLE, AND LET

THE VERSION THAT
WORKS BEST FOR
EACH CLIENT.
that might just outperform the
benchmarks. Consider, for example,
the fund-of-CEFs (Closed-End Funds)
approach, which combines the steady
income of traditional bonds with the
potential for capital appreciation of
stocks.
With more distribution channels opening
up, more advisors have access to more
sophisticated tools. It’s all about finding
the right fit for each client.

GO BEYOND THE PASSIVE
SCREEN
The evolving world of ETFs offers
boundless opportunities, with
innovative options like single-stock
ETFs, metaverse funds, and specialpurpose acquisition company ETFs.
But with thousands to choose from,
finding the right fit can be daunting,
and it can be tempting to lean on
familiar ways.
Don’t limit yourself to just one source.
Listen to what other advisors are
saying, keep an ear to the ground on
financial media, and consider more
than just the numbers. The market
is full of potential winners, and while
being the first to adopt a new ETF
might seem appealing, it’s not always
the smartest move.
Instead, let the market do some of the
heavy lifting. Let others beta-test new
products and see how they perform
in the real world. Consider jumping
in when an ETF’s assets reach a
certain threshold, say $1 billion. A live
track record will provide real-world
insights that backtests simply can’t,

10

and watching how a fund performs
during market ups and downs will
help build your confidence in its future.
Remember, the more assets a fund
attracts, the better its liquidity, which in
turn reduces trading costs. And if the
broader market is flowing money into
a particular ETF, chances are it’s onto
something good. Keep your eyes and
ears open, there’s more than one way
to find an opportunity.

REFRESHER COURSE:
WHY ETFs AT ALL?
Many advisors love exchange-traded
funds, and for good reason:
Diversification: ETFs offer exposure
to various assets, such as stocks,
bonds, commodities, or sectors. This
diversification helps reduce risk by
spreading investments across multiple
holdings.
Cost-effectiveness: ETFs typically
have lower expense ratios than
mutual funds. This is because ETFs
are passively managed and aim to
replicate the performance of a specific
index rather than actively selecting and
managing individual securities.
Liquidity: ETFs trade on stock
exchanges throughout the day,
allowing investors to buy or sell shares
at market prices. This liquidity provides
flexibility and ease of trading, especially
during volatile market conditions.
Transparency: ETFs provide
transparency as they disclose their
holdings daily. Investors can see
the underlying securities and their
weightings, enabling them to make
informed investment decisions. Mutual
funds, on the other hand, typically
disclose their holdings quarterly.
Tax efficiency: ETFs are structured
in a way that can be more tax-efficient
compared to mutual funds. Due to
their unique creation and redemption
process, ETFs can minimize capital
gains distributions, potentially reducing
tax liabilities for investors.
Flexibility: ETFs provide flexibility in
terms of investment strategies and
asset classes. Investors can choose

2025 THE TOP ETF INNOVATORS
ETFs aim to mirror the performance
of renowned indexes such as the
S&P 500, offering exposure to broad
market movements or specific
segments. You can effectively diversify
any investment portfolio or tailor risk/
return characteristics by combining
different ETFs representing diverse
asset classes or industries.

from a wide range of ETFs that cover
various market segments, sectors,
geographic regions, or investment
themes, allowing them to tailor their
portfolios to their specific investment
objectives.
However, some advisors have been
more reluctant, preferring to keep
clients in conventional 40 Act mutual
funds or individual securities. But
remember, diversifying a portfolio with
ETFs is hassle-free.

KNOW THE RISKS
The broad spectrum of securities
within ETFs can help mitigate risk; if
a few holdings decline in value, the
remaining assets within the ETF can
help offset losses. While ETFs don’t
eliminate risk entirely, they often entail
less risk compared to investing solely
in individual companies.

Instead of selecting individual stocks
or bonds, investing in ETFs grants
clients ownership of a fund comprising
numerous securities. These funds
span various categories and even
cross-asset classes, providing
direct exposure to bonds, stocks,
commodities, derivatives, and more
complex instruments.

Tracking error: ETFs aim to replicate
the performance of a specific index
or asset class. However, there can be
a slight difference between the ETF’s
performance and the underlying index
due to factors like fees, trading costs,
and imperfect replication. This tracking
error can impact returns.
Liquidity risk: While ETFs are generally
considered liquid investments, some
ETFs may have lower trading volumes
and less liquidity than others. This can
result in wider bid-ask spreads and
potential difficulty in buying or selling
shares at desired prices, especially
during volatile market conditions.

There are risks associated with ETF
investing, including those detailed
below.

And exposure is as broad or narrow
as you need for your clients. Many

Market risk: ETFs are subject
to market fluctuations and can
experience losses due to factors such
as economic conditions, geopolitical
events, or changes in investor
sentiment. If the underlying assets in
the ETF decline in value, the ETF’s
price will also decrease.

A VAST UNIVERSE TO EXPLORE

T

he “random walk” message succeeded too well and now the big index fund complexes dominate the ETF market with
trillions of dollars in AUM. They’re mass market brands with a gigantic market footprint you can practically see from
space. And that’s great for investors who don’t want to be anywhere but in the lowest common denominator.

But your clients are special. They want special treatment and are willing to pay for a more rarefied experience than they can
get in the trillion-dollar crowd. That’s why they’re your clients, right? And that’s why we urge every advisor to dig a little deeper
for great ideas. Maybe there’s a strategy hidden on the screen that delivers tangible alpha even after you factor out fees.
Maybe there’s a way to smooth the specific parts of the market cycle that make your clients nervous.
In our view, the rise of “old fashioned” active security selection in the ETF format is the most exciting thing to happen in asset
management over the past decade. These funds are a long way from world domination. That’s the opportunity. Finding the
right differentiated solution for a client’s differentiated situation is how you get ahead of the curve. The passive walk is random.
Yours is planned.

2025 THE TOP ETF INNOVATORS
Sector concentration risk: Some
ETFs focus on specific sectors or
industries. The ETF’s performance may
be negatively affected if the sector
experiences a downturn or faces
regulatory or economic challenges.
Counterparty risk: Certain ETFs use
derivatives or engage in securities
lending to achieve their investment
objectives. This introduces
counterparty risk, as the ETF is
exposed to the counterparties’
creditworthiness. If a counterparty
defaults, it can impact the ETF’s
performance.
Tax considerations: ETF investors may
be subject to capital gains taxes when
selling shares, especially if the ETF
has a significant turnover or distributes
capital gains to shareholders. It’s
essential to understand the tax
implications of investing in ETFs.
Embracing ETFs can save your clients
money in the long run. Unlike individual
stock transactions that incur fees each
time, ETFs involve a single transaction
fee for access to a comprehensive
array of assets.
Although management fees still
apply, ETFs generally boast lower
annual expenses than mutual funds.
For instance, the average equity ETF
charges a modest 0.53% in annual
costs, considerably lower than the
1.42% charged by the typical U.S.
equity mutual fund.
ETFs offer the flexibility of trading
akin to stocks. While mutual funds
only trade at day’s end, ETFs trade
continuously throughout market
hours, akin to traditional stocks and
commodities.
This real-time trading capability
empowers investors to buy and sell
ETF shares at their discretion, just as
they would with individual stocks. With
ETFs exchanging hands hundreds
of times daily on the stock market,
investors enjoy the freedom to enter
swiftly and exit positions.

THE COST STRUCTURE
ETFs make money through a
combination of management fees,
transaction fees, and securities
lending.
Management fees: ETFs charge
investors an annual management fee,
also known as an expense ratio. This
fee is a percentage of the total assets
under management and covers the
costs associated with managing the
ETF, including portfolio management,
administration, and marketing.
Transaction fees: ETFs may also
generate revenue from transaction
fees. These fees are charged when
investors buy or sell shares of the ETF.
The transaction fees vary depending
on the brokerage platform used and
the specific ETF.
Securities lending: Some ETFs engage
in securities lending to generate
additional income. In securities
lending, the ETF lends out a portion
of its portfolio holdings, typically to
institutional investors, in exchange for
collateral. The ETF earns income from
the interest or fees charged on the
loaned securities.
The management fees ETF providers
charge can vary based on several
factors, including the investment
strategy, the complexity of the fund,
and the assets under management.
There are a few reasons why some
ETFs may charge higher fees
compared to other ETFs.
Active vs. passive management: ETFs
that are actively managed, meaning
the fund manager actively selects and
manages the underlying assets, tend to
have higher fees compared to passively
managed ETFs. Active management
involves more research, Analysis, and
trading, which can increase the costs
associated with managing the fund.
Complexity and specialized strategies:
Some ETFs employ complex
investment strategies or focus on niche
markets or sectors. These specialized
ETFs may require more expertise and
resources to manage, resulting in
higher fees.

13

Assets under management: Larger
ETFs with a higher amount of assets
under management can benefit from
economies of scale. As the fund
grows, the management fees can
be spread across a more extensive
asset base, resulting in lower fees for
investors. Conversely, smaller ETFs
may have higher fees to cover their
operating costs.
Index licensing fees: Some ETFs track
proprietary or custom indexes, which
may require licensing fees to use. These
licensing fees can contribute to higher
expense ratios for the ETF.
Trading costs: ETFs that have higher
trading volumes and more liquidity tend
to have lower trading costs, which
can be reflected in lower expense
ratios. On the other hand, ETFs with
lower trading volumes or less liquid
underlying assets may have higher
trading costs, leading to higher fees
Alpha: If you deliver better results, you
deserve to charge a premium fee. And
it can make sense for investors to pay
that fee.

THE RETURN PROFILE
Clients or investors can make money
from ETFs in a few ways:
Capital appreciation: If the price of
the ETF’s underlying assets increases,
the value of the ETF shares will also
increase. Investors can sell their shares
at a higher price than they initially paid,
resulting in a capital gain.
Dividends and interest: Some ETFs
invest in assets that generate income,
such as stocks that pay dividends or
bonds that pay interest. Investors in
these ETFs can receive a portion of the
revenue generated by the underlying
assets in the form of dividends or
interest payments.
Distributions: ETFs may distribute
capital gains to investors if the fund
sells securities at a profit. These
distributions are typically made
annually or semi-annually and can be
reinvested or taken as cash.

2025 THE TOP ETF INNOVATORS
CATEGORY AND STYLE
There is no definitive number of ETF

financials, XLE for energy, XLK for
technology, etc.)
International ETFs: International ETFs
provide exposure to stocks or bonds
of companies or countries outside

of the investor’s home country. They
can focus on specific regions, such as
Europe, Asia, or emerging markets, or
provide broad global exposure.
Sample international ETF tickers: iShares
MSCI EAFE ETF (EFA), Vanguard FTSE
Emerging Markets ETF (VWO)
Commodity ETFs: Commodity
ETFs invest in physical commodities
like gold, silver, oil, natural gas, or
agricultural products. They can provide
exposure to the price movements of
these commodities without the need
for physical ownership.

There are several different styles of ETF
investing that investors can consider
based on their investment objectives
and preferences:
Passive/index investing: This style
involves investing in ETFs that aim to
replicate the performance of a specific
index, such as the S&P 500 or the
FTSE 100. Passive/index ETFs typically
have low expense ratios and seek to
provide broad market exposure.
Active investing: Active ETFs are
managed by portfolio managers
who aim to outperform a benchmark
index through active stock selection
and market timing. Due to the active
management involved, these ETFs
may have higher expense ratios
compared to passive/index ETFs.
Value investing: Value ETFs focus on
investing in stocks that are considered
undervalued based on fundamental
Analysis. These ETFs typically seek out
companies with low price-to-earnings
(P/E) ratios, low price-to-book (P/B)
ratios, or other value-oriented metrics.
Growth investing: Growth
ETFs target companies that are
expected to experience aboveaverage growth rates in earnings or
revenue. These ETFs typically invest

in companies with high price-toearnings (P/E) ratios or high price-tosales (P/S) ratios.
Dividend investing: Dividend ETFs
focus on investing in stocks that pay
regular dividends. These ETFs may
target companies with a history of
consistent dividend payments, high
dividend yields, or dividend growth.
Momentum investing: Momentum
ETFs seek to capture the trendfollowing strategy by investing in
stocks or other assets that have
shown positive price momentum.
These ETFs aim to benefit from the
continuation of recent price trends.
Quality investing: Quality ETFs focus
on investing in companies with strong
financials, stable earnings, and solid
balance sheets. These ETFs typically
target companies with high return on

equity (ROE), low debt levels, and
consistent profitability.
Low-volatility investing: Lowvolatility ETFs invest in stocks or other
assets that have historically exhibited
lower price volatility compared to the
broader market. These ETFs aim to
provide downside protection during
market downturns.
Factor-based investing: Factorbased ETFs follow specific investment
factors such as value, growth,
momentum, quality, or low volatility.
These ETFs aim to capture the excess
returns associated with these factors
and may combine multiple factors in
their investment approach.
ESG investing: ESG (environmental,
social, and governance) ETFs
focus on investing in companies
that meet certain sustainability and

15

ethical criteria. These ETFs consider
environmental and social impact and
corporate governance practices in their
investment selection.
These styles of ETF investing are not
mutually exclusive, and investors can
combine different styles based on their
investment goals and risk tolerance.
Additionally, the availability and specific
characteristics of ETFs within each
style may vary among other providers.

FROM ASSET CLASS TO
ALLOCATION
Equity ETFs mirror an index of stocks,
offering a range of options from
large to small businesses and even
country-specific stocks. They also
provide exposure to specific sectors
like technology or banking, catering
to investors looking to capitalize on
current market trends.

DIVERSIFYING
A PORTFOLIO IS
KEY, AND BOND
OR FIXED-INCOME
ETFs OFFER A
STABLE RETURN
WITH POTENTIALLY
LOWER RISK
COMPARED TO
EQUITIES.

Alternative Investments: Some
ETFs offer exposure to alternative
investments, such as hedge fund
strategies, private equity, infrastructure,
or volatility indexes.

Diversifying a portfolio is key, and
bond or fixed-income ETFs offer a
stable return with potentially lower risk
compared to equities. Professionals
favor these investments because of
their role in spreading investment risk.

Finally, the rapidly expanding range
of sustainable ETFs integrates
environmental, social, and governance
(ESG) considerations into traditional
investment approaches. Driven by
demographic shifts, government
policies, and evolving risk perceptions,
sustainable investing is gaining traction
among a diverse investor base.
Recently, there has been a significant
rise in the introduction of innovative
ETF products that specifically cater to
today’s investors’ environmental and
socially responsible preferences. These
products offer investors the chance to
align their investments with modern
themes and trends and provide an
avenue to support their environmental
and social values.

Commodities like gold, silver, or
oil can be challenging to access
directly, making ETFs an attractive
option. However, they may need to
be more transparent, often utilizing
derivatives to track commodity prices,
which introduces additional risks like
counterparty risk.
Currency ETFs invest directly or
through derivatives in single or multiple
currencies (and now cryptocurrencies).
While offering opportunities for
currency speculation or hedging, they
also carry added risk, particularly when
derivatives are involved.
Leveraged and inverse ETFs cater to
investors seeking amplified returns
but come with significantly higher risk.
Inverse funds rise when the target
index falls, mimicking short-selling,
while leveraged funds aim to enhance
returns by borrowing additional funds,
denoted by multiples like 2X.

Real estate ETFs invest in real estate
investment trusts (REITs) or actual
estate-related companies, providing
exposure to the real estate market
without direct property ownership.
Factor investing targets specific drivers
of returns across asset classes, often
implemented through rules-based
ETFs known as “Smart Beta.” This
strategy, long utilized by institutional
investors and active managers,
provides investors with exposure to
various market factors.

ACTIVE MANAGER, ETF WRAPPER
The core concept of an actively managed
ETF revolves around portfolio managers
making strategic adjustments to the
fund’s investments without being bound
by the strictures of tracking an index,
unlike passively managed ETFs.
These managers seek to surpass
a benchmark through meticulous
research and strategic decisions. Like
their passive counterparts, traditional
actively managed ETFs disclose

16

their holdings daily and are traded
throughout the day, setting them apart
from comparable mutual funds.
While passive ETFs have historically
dominated the market and still
command a significant share of ETF
assets, the actively managed segment
has witnessed remarkable growth and
substantial inflows.
Some advantages include:
Potential for higher returns: Unlike
passively managed ETFs that aim to
track a benchmark, actively managed
ETFs have the potential to outperform
the benchmark through strategic
investment decisions.
Lower costs compared to similar
funds: The structure of actively
managed ETFs may allow for lower
expenses relative to comparable mutual
funds. On average, ETFs generally
have lower costs compared to mutual
funds. When examining the average
management fees across various
strategies, purely passive and hybrid
ETFs (such as smart beta and thematic
ETFs) have approximately 20% lower
fees on average compared to passively
managed and hybrid mutual funds.
The difference in management fees
becomes even more pronounced for
purely actively managed funds, with
actively managed ETFs having nearly
50% lower costs compared to actively
managed mutual funds.1
Flexibility: Similar to index ETFs,
actively managed ETFs offer investors
the flexibility to trade throughout the
day, including engaging in short sales
and margin trading. This potentially
enhances liquidity compared to funds
without intraday trading capabilities.

DON’T FORGET TAX ALPHA
Tax alpha refers to the additional aftertax returns that can be generated by
implementing tax-efficient investment
¹Note: the number of active ETFs available in the market is
still significantly smaller (about 500 ETFs) compared to the
number of mutual funds (more than 14,000).

strategies. ETFs are often associated
with tax alpha due to their unique
structure and features.
ETFs are widely known for their tax
efficiency, but delving into the intricacies
of the tax treatment of different asset
classes unveils a landscape of complexity.
Continue reading to gain insight into
capital gains distributions, dividends,
interest, K-1 statements, collectibles,
tax rates, and more. Understanding
these nuances could lead to tax savings.
ETFs can potentially contribute to
tax alpha in several ways:.
In-kind creations and redemptions:
ETFs utilize an in-kind creation and
redemption process, which allows
authorized participants (APs) to
exchange a basket of securities for ETF
shares or vice versa. This mechanism
helps ETFs minimize taxable capital
gains distributions. When an AP
redeems ETF shares, the ETF can
distribute low-cost basis securities,
reducing the potential for capital gains.
Lower portfolio turnover: ETFs,
particularly index-based ETFs, tend to
have lower portfolio turnover compared
to actively managed mutual funds.
Lower turnover means fewer taxable
events, resulting in potential tax
savings for investors.
Tax efficiency of indexing: Many ETFs
are designed to track specific indexes,
which can lead to tax efficiency.
Indexing strategies generally involve less
frequent buying and selling of securities,
reducing the realization of capital gains
and associated tax liabilities.
Tax-loss harvesting: ETFs can be
used for tax-loss harvesting strategies.
Investors can sell ETFs that have
experienced losses to offset capital
gains from other investments, potentially
reducing their overall tax liability.

Equity and bond ETFs—capital
gains: ETF investors have more control
over realizing capital gains. They can
choose when to sell their ETF shares,

ETFs ARE WIDELY KNOWN FOR THEIR
TAX EFFICIENCY, BUT DELVING INTO THE
INTRICACIES OF THE TAX TREATMENT OF
DIFFERENT ASSET CLASSES UNVEILS A
LANDSCAPE OF COMPLEXITY.
allowing for greater flexibility in managing their tax obligations. ETFs, mainly
passively managed equity ones, are
lauded for their tax efficiency. These
funds typically track an index passively,
resulting in minimal capital gains distributions compared to actively managed
mutual funds. Additionally, ETF managers have strategies to mitigate capital
gains when creating or redeeming
shares.
However, ETFs holding dividendpaying stocks will distribute earnings
to shareholders, usually annually, while
dividend-focused ETFs may do so
more frequently. Qualified dividends
may enjoy lower tax rates, while
interest from bond ETFs is taxed as
ordinary income.
The taxation depends on the holding
period and income level when selling
an equity or bond ETF. Holding for
more than a year subjects gains to
long-term capital gains taxes, while
shorter durations lead to ordinary
income tax rates.

Commodity ETFs—K-1s and the
60/40 rule: Commodity ETFs, which
invest via futures contracts, can complicate tax filings. Structured as limited
partnerships, these ETFs issue K-1
forms, potentially delaying tax reporting. Moreover, investors may face unrelated business taxable income (UBTI)
concerns.
The 60/40 rule governs gains and
losses from commodity ETF sales,
attributing 60% to long-term gains and
40% to short-term profits, regardless

17

of holding duration. This rule impacts
taxation irrespective of the ETF’s
holding period.
To simplify tax treatment, newer
commodity ETFs allocate a portion of
assets to offshore subsidiaries, treating
investments more akin to equities or
bonds.

Precious metals ETFs—collectibles tax
rate: ETFs focused on precious metals,
structured as grantor trusts, are taxed
as collectibles. Long-term gains face
a maximum rate of 31.8%, with shortterm gains taxed as ordinary income.
However, ETFs structured differently
may have distinct tax implications.
Currency ETFs: Currency ETFs’
taxation varies based on structure.
Open-end funds face long-term rates
up to 23.8% or short-term rates up
to 40.8%, while grantor trusts or
limited partnerships adhere to the
60/40 rule or ordinary income rates,
respectively.
Investing in exchange-traded notes
(ETNs): ETNs pose credit risk, as they
rely on the issuer’s credit. Although
they don’t distribute dividends or
interest, selling ETNs may incur capital
gains taxes similar to ETFs.
Understanding the tax implications of
ETFs and ETNs is crucial for informed
investment decisions.

WHO OWNS THE
SECURITIES?
When considering an ETF,
understanding its structure is essential
as it determines how the target index

2025 THE TOP ETF INNOVATORS
is tracked, its assets, and the level
of visibility and risk involved. These
factors ultimately influence total cost
and expected returns.
Most ETFs in the market today follow
the physical replication method. These
ETFs offer simplicity and transparency
by directly holding some or all of the
underlying assets of the target index.
For instance, an ETF tracking the STI
(Straits Times Index) may have either
all the stocks listed on the STI or a
selected core basket of those stocks.
Synthetic ETFs do not invest directly
in assets but instead use derivatives,
such as futures contracts, to replicate
the performance of the target index.
For example, a synthetic ETF tracking
crude oil might hold a series of oil
futures contracts, typically arranged
with a third party such as an
investment bank.
Synthetic ETFs appeal to investors
seeking exposure to assets that
are not easily accessible through
traditional exchanges, such as China
A shares, or to commodities that are
challenging to hold directly, like crude
oil. While offering potentially higher
returns, synthetic ETFs also come with
increased risk, notably counterparty
risk—the risk that the counterparty
fails to deliver the agreed-upon returns
specified in the ETF contract.

WHERE WE GO FROM HERE
The ETF market has experienced
substantial growth over the past two
decades, with notable advancements
in the last five years.
During this period, there has been a
surge in the introduction of innovative
ETF products that cater to the
environmental and socially responsible
preferences of today’s investors.
While ETFs have traditionally been
associated with passive investments
that track broad equity indexes,
the ETF landscape is entering a
new phase of growth driven by the
emergence of active ETFs.

The outlook for the ETF industry is
generally positive, with several factors
contributing to its continued growth and
development. Several key trends and
factors are shaping a favorable position.
Increasing adoption: The adoption
of ETFs by both retail and institutional
investors is expected to continue
growing. ETFs offer benefits such
as diversification, liquidity, and costefficiency, which make them attractive
investment options.
Innovation and product expansion:
The ETF industry is witnessing
ongoing innovation, with the
introduction of new and specialized
ETF products. This includes thematic
ETFs, ESG-focused ETFs, actively
managed ETFs, and ETFs targeting
specific sectors or asset classes.
This product expansion will attract
investors seeking exposure to specific
investment themes or strategies.
ESG and sustainable investing:
Environmental, social, and governance
(ESG) investing is gaining prominence,
and ETFs focused on ESG and
sustainable investing are experiencing
increased demand. Investors are
increasingly seeking investment
options that align with their values and
have a positive impact.
Technological advancements:
Technology continues to play a
significant role in the ETF industry.
Digital platforms and robo-advisors
are making it easier for investors
to access and invest in ETFs.
Additionally, trading technology
and data analytics advancements
are enhancing the efficiency and
transparency of ETF trading and
management.
Regulatory developments:
Regulatory changes and
advancements are shaping the
ETF industry. For example, the
introduction of non-transparent and
semi-transparent ETF structures has
expanded the possibilities for active
management within the ETF space.

18

Regulatory frameworks are also
evolving globally to accommodate
the growth and complexity of the ETF
industry.
Global expansion: The ETF industry
is expanding globally, with increased
adoption and product offerings
in various regions. While the U.S.
remains the largest market for ETFs,
Europe and Asia are experiencing
significant growth and are expected to
contribute to the industry’s expansion.

Alpha: A measure of performance on a risk-adjusted basis. Alpha takes the volatility (price risk) of a fund and compares its risk-adjusted performance to a benchmark index. The excess
return of the fund relative to the return of the benchmark is a fund’s alpha.

Disclosures: The fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses must be considered carefully before investing. The statutory prospectus and
prospectus contain this and other important information about the investment company, and it may be obtained by calling 215-882-9983 or visiting
https://alphabluecapitalabcs.com/. Read it carefully before investing.
Investments involve risk. Principal loss is possible. The Fund is actively-managed and is subject to the risk that the strategy may not produce the intended results. The Fund is new
and has a limited operating history to evaluate.
Growth-Style Investing Risk. Stocks of companies the Sub-Adviser believes are fast-growing may trade at a higher multiple of current earnings than other stocks. If the Sub-Adviser’s
assessment of a company’s prospects for earnings growth, or how other investors will value the company’s earnings growth, is incorrect, the price of the stock may fall or may never
reach the value the Sub-Adviser has placed on it. Value-Style Investing Risk. Value stocks can perform differently from the market as a whole and from other types of stocks. Value
stocks may be purchased based upon the Sub-Adviser’s belief that the stock may be out of favor. Value investing seeks to identify stocks that have depressed valuations, based upon
a number of factors which are thought to be temporary in nature, and to sell them at superior profits should their prices rise in response to resolution of the issues which caused the
valuation of the stock to be depressed. Foreign Securities Risk. Investments in non-U.S. securities involve risks that may not be present with investments in U.S. securities. For
example, investments in non-U.S. securities may be subject to risk of loss due to foreign currency fluctuations or to political or economic instability. Non-Diversification Risk. Because
the Fund is non-diversified, it may be more sensitive to economic, business, political or other changes affecting individual issuers or investments than a diversified fund, which may
result in greater fluctuation in the value of the Fund’s Shares and greater risk of loss. Business Development Company (BDC) Risk. BDCs generally invest in less mature U.S. private
companies or thinly traded U.S. public companies which involve greater risk than well-established publicly traded companies. Real Estate Investment Risk. The Fund’s investments in real
estate companies and companies related to the real estate industry subject the Fund to risks associated with the direct ownership of real estate securities. New Fund Risk. The Fund
is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors have no track record or history on which to base their investment
decision. There can be no assurance that the Fund will grow to or maintain an economically viable size. Small-Capitalization Companies Risk. Investing in securities of smallcapitalization companies involves greater risk than customarily is associated with investing in larger, more established companies.
ETFs may trade at a premium or discount to their net asset value. Redemptions are limited and often brokerage commissions are charged on each trade which may reduce returns.
The fund may invest in medium-capitalization companies which may be subject to greater risks than large company stocks due to limited resources and inventory as well as more
sensitivity to adverse market conditions.
The Fund is distributed by Quasar Distributors, LLC. The Fund investment advisor is Empowered Funds, LLC, which is doing business as EA Advisers. The Fund’s sub-advisor is Alpha

There are risks associated with investing, including possible loss of principal. Fixed income investments are subject to interest rate risk; their value will normally decline as
interest rates rise. Fixed income investments are also subject to credit risk, the risk that the issuer of a bond will fail to pay interest and principal in a timely manner, or that
negative perceptions of the issuer’s ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond to decline. Securities that are rated below investment-grade (sometimes
referred to as “junk bonds”) be deemed speculative, may involve greater levels of risk than higher-rated securities of similar maturity and may be more likely to default. Investing

Kinetics Inflation
Beneficiaries
Active ETF (INFL)
Horizon Kinetics believes that
the era of highly accommodative
financial conditions has ended,
as structural shifts in economic
growth and inflation have
resulted in higher interest rates.
This emergent market regime is
likely to favor finite hard asset
exposure, such as energy, base
and precious metals, agriculture,
and certain financial services.
The Inflation Beneficiaries
Fund (INFL) is distinguished
by its focus on high quality,
“capital light” business models
that operate in these hard asset
end markets. The businesses
generate high returns through
full market cycles, hence do
not require rising price levels
to achieve strong returns. The
bespoke portfolio includes
niche business models such as
royalties, financial exchanges,
and other high margin hard
asset companies. INFL can
benefit a portfolio through
various uses, namely quality,
diversification, and real asset
exposure.

Horizon Kinetics is a research-driven,
fundamentals-oriented asset manager
($7.4 billion in assets under management
(“AUM”) as of June 30, 2024) serving
institutions, individuals, and financial
professionals. The Firm’s founders and lead
investors have worked together for over
thirty years, dating back to their tenure at
Bankers Trust Company.
• We are contrarian investors, and our vision
is diametrically opposed to the movement
of the crowd.
• Our investment approach stresses
absolute returns, blending a combination

of fundamental research, discipline,
and patience with the goal of long-term
preservation and compounding of capital.
• We measure risk as an impairment of
capital. Returns can be increased by
extension of the investment horizon rather
than by extension of risk.
• Our strategies are driven by fundamental
research and opportunity, not capacity for
asset gathering.
• We invest alongside our clients and
believe that a skin in the game approach
is critical to aligning interests.

INFL for Quality, Diversification,
and Real Asset Exposure
The Horizon Kinetics Inflation Beneficiaries ETF is an actively managed ETF that seeks

Investing involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. Shares of any ETF are bought and sold at market price (not NAV), may trade at a discount or premium to NAV and are not
individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. The Fund’s investments in securities linked to real assets involve significant risks, including financial,

downturn in the economy in which the asset is located.
The Fund is non-diversified, meaning it may concentrate its assets in fewer individual holdings than a diversified fund. Therefore, the Fund is more exposed to individual stock volatility
than a diversified fund. The Fund invests in foreign securities which involve greater volatility and political, economic and currency risks and differences in accounting methods. These
risks are greater for investments in emerging markets. The S&P 500 Index is a broad-based index intended to show the performance of the 500 largest companies listed on stock
exchanges in the United States.
The Fund may invest in the securities of smaller and mid-capitalization companies, which may be more volatile than funds that invest in larger, more established companies. The fund is
actively managed and may be affected by the investment adviser’s security selections. Diversification does not assure a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market.

dynamic market exposure
that adjusts based on market

Other advisors may aim

HULL TACTICAL US ETF

About the Hull Tactical US ETF (HTUS) Investment Strategy
HTUS is an actively managed exchange traded fund (ETF) driven by various proprietary analytical investment models that examine current and historical market data to attempt to
predict the performance of the S&P 500® Index (the “S&P 500®”), a widely recognized benchmark of U.S. stock market performance that is composed primarily of large-capitalization
U.S. issuers. The models deliver investment signals that the Adviser uses to make investment decisions for the Fund. The investment models used are to anticipate forward market
movements and position the Fund to take advantage of these movements. Currently, signals are combined into an ‘ensemble’ array that spans statistical, behavior-sentimental, technical,
fundamental, and economic data sources. This combined signal is generated each trading day towards the close of the market and dictates whether the Fund is long/short and the
magnitude of position sizing. The Adviser routinely evaluates the performance and impact of each model on the Fund with the goal of realizing a risk/return profile that is superior to that
of a buy and hold strategy.
The use of derivative instruments involves risks different from, or possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments. These
risks include (i) the risk that the counterparty to a derivative transaction may not fulfill its contractual obligations; (ii) risk of mispricing or improper valuation; and (iii) the risk that changes
in the value of the derivative may not correlate perfectly with the underlying asset, rate, or index. Derivative prices are highly volatile and may fluctuate substantially during a short period
of time. The use of leverage by the Fund, such as borrowing money to purchase securities or the use of options, will cause the Fund to incur additional expenses and magnify the Fund’s
gains or losses. The Fund’s investment in fixed income securities is subject to credit risk (the debtor may default) and prepayment risk (an obligation paid early) which could cause its
share price and total return to be reduced. Typically, as interest rates rise the value of bond prices will decline and the fund could lose value.
While the option overlay is intended to improve the Fund’s performance, there is no guarantee that it will do so. Utilizing an option overlay strategy involves the risk that as the buyer of a
put or call option, the Fund risks losing the entire premium invested in the option if the Fund does not exercise the option. Also, securities and options traded in over-the-counter markets
may trade less frequently and in limited volumes and thus exhibit more volatility and liquidity risk.
HTAA, LLC serves as the investment advisor. The Fund is distributed by Northern Lights Distributors, LLC (225 Pictoria Drive, Suite 450, Cincinnati, OH 45246), which is not affiliated with
HTAA, LLC.
Carefully consider the Fund’s investment objectives, risk factors, charges, and expenses before investing. This and additional information can be found in the Fund’s
prospectus, which may be obtained by visiting www.hulltacticalfunds.com or calling toll-free 1-844-484-2484. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.
There is no guarantee that the investment objectives will be achieved. Moreover, past performance is not a guarantee or indicator of future results.

An investment in the Funds is subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of principal. Pacer ETF shares may be bought and sold on an exchange through a brokerage

Dividends Risk: There can be no assurance that a dividend-paying company will continue to make regular dividend payments. The ability for a company to pay dividends is
dependent on the economic climate and the companies’ current earnings and capital resources. Changes in economic conditions or a company’s earnings or financial resources
could cause a company to reduce its dividend payments or suspend the payment of dividends altogether. The possibility that such companies could reduce or eliminate the
payment of dividends in the future, especially if the companies are facing an economic downturn, could negatively affect the Fund’s performance.

SPROTT ASSET
MANAGEMENT
John Ciampaglia,
CFA, FCSI
Chief Executive
Officer
Every aspect of energy
production, transmission and
storage requires resources that
are mined—materials such as
uranium, copper and others.
As the world works to meet the
growing energy requirements
of rising middle classes and
technologies such as AI,
while also pursuing net-zero
emission mandates, demand
for critical materials is rising. In
the process, the gap between
critical material demand
and projected supplies is
widening—shining a spotlight
on years of underinvestment in
the mining sector.
We believe renewing interest
in mine production, rebuilding
critical material supply chains,
working toward energy security,
and reshoring fuel sources may
mean that uranium, copper
and other miners may offer
long-term growth potential for
investors. We offer a suite of
mining equity ETFs so you can
pursue the opportunity.

The clean energy transition is accelerating
as global countries seek reliable, affordable
sources of electricity and strive to reach netzero emissions by 2050. Today, 152 nuclear
reactors are under construction or planned
for construction,¹ electric vehicle adoption is
reaching a tipping point, global energy grids
are being upgraded, and wind, solar and
other clean energy projects are proliferating.
The demand for critical materials required for
these projects—such as uranium, copper,
silver, lithium, nickel and others—is quickly
outstripping supply. As a result, we believe
miners of these materials are incentivized

to increase production and expand
operations—positioning them for growth.
Sprott Asset Management is a global
leader in precious metals and critical
materials investments. We are specialists,
with decades of experience in the mining
and commodity sectors. Our Sprott
Energy Transition ETF suite offers pureplay exposure to critical minerals and their
miners, making it easier to add exposure
to essential energy transition materials
like uranium, copper and battery metals to
your portfolio.

Sprott Energy Transition ETFs:
Exposure to the Elements of Energy
The Sprott Energy Transition ETFs provide investors with pure-play* investment exposure
to the minerals critical to the world’s transition to clean energy through access to mining
companies and physical materials that we believe are positioned to benefit from quickly
increasing demand and limited supplies.

and the possibility of significant losses. An investment in the Funds involves a substantial degree of risk. The Funds are non-diversified and can invest a greater portion of
assets in securities of individual issuers than a diversified fund. As a result, changes in the market value of a single investment could cause greater fluctuations in share
price than would occur in a diversified fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. “Authorized participants” may invest directly with the Fund, typically in blocks
of 10,000 shares. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses, affect the Fund’s performance. Sprott Asset Management USA, Inc. is the

Risk Information
Carefully consider the Fund’s investment objectives, risk factors, charges and expenses before investing. This and additional information can be found in the Fund’s
prospectus or summary prospectus, which may be obtained by visiting www.temaetfs.com. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.
Diversification does not ensure profits or prevent losses.
Investing involves risk including possible loss of principal. The Funds may invest a significant portion of their assets in one or more sectors and thus will be more susceptible to
the risks affecting those sectors than funds that have more diversified holdings across a number of sectors. There is no guarantee the adviser’s investment will be successful in
identifying and investing in thematic trends.
The small- and mid-capitalization companies in which the Funds invest may be more vulnerable to adverse business or economic events than larger, more established
companies, and may underperform other segments of the market or the equity market as a whole.
International and emerging market investing may involve risk of capital loss from unfavorable fluctuations in currency values, from differences in generally accepted accounting
principles, or from economic or political instability in other nations. Frontier markets generally have less developed capital markets than traditional emerging market countries,
and, consequently, the risks of investing in foreign securities are magnified in such countries.
Because the Funds evaluate ESG factors to assess and exclude certain investments for non-financial reasons, the Funds may forego some market opportunities available to funds
that do not use these ESG factors.

Ed Lopez
Head of ETF
Product
As the person responsible for
ETF product and marketing
strategy, Ed Lopez is always
on the lookout for untapped
asset classes and opportunities
to improve the core investor
experience.
Besides being an ETF industry
expert, spokesperson and
frequent panelist at conferences,
Ed Lopez is also the host of
VanEck’s Trends With Benefits
podcast, talking to guests to
uncover new ways of thinking
about the markets, investing,
work and life.

For nearly 70 years, VanEck has sought to
identify trends—economic, technological,
political and social—that shape financial
markets. We consider whether these
create opportunities, perhaps even new
asset classes, or present potential risks to
existing portfolios. Through intelligently
designed, competitively priced

solutions, we empower investors to gain
exposure effectively.
Recently, we have taken significant strides
to increase investor access to bitcoin
and remain committed to arming investors
with knowledge. We’re builders not just
observers.

“Don’t settle for the conventional.
Dare to be different.” —CEO Jan van Eck
VanEck was one of the first U.S. asset managers to offer investors access to international
markets and recognized early the transformative potential of gold investing, emerging
markets, ETFs and digital assets. Today, our firm’s capabilities range from core investment
opportunities to more specialized exposures to enhance portfolio diversification.

This material must be preceded or accompanied by a prospectus. An investment in the Trust may not be suitable for all investors. Before investing you should
carefully consider the VanEck Bitcoin Trust’s (the “Trust”) investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses.
An investment in the Trust may involve significant risk, and may not be suitable for all investors. We use the generic term “ETF” to refer to exchange-traded
investment vehicles, including those that are required to register under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “40 Act”), as well as other exchangetraded products which are not subject to the registration of the ‘40 Act. The Fund is not registered under the 1940 Act and is not subject to regulation under the 1940
Act, unlike most exchange traded products or ETFs. An investment in the Trust is subject to risks which include, but are not limited to, the historically and potentially
future extreme volatility of bitcoin, various potential factors that may adversely affect the liquidity of Trust shares, the limited history of the Index from which the
value of bitcoin and hence the value of Trust shares will be determined, potential threats to the Trust’s bitcoin custodian, and the unregulated nature and lack of
transparency surrounding the operations of bitcoin trading platforms, all of which may ultimately adversely affect the value of shares of the Trust. Please note that
this is not an exhaustive list of risks pertaining to the Trust. Please read carefully the prospectus for a complete list of potential risks. The Sponsor of the Trust is
VanEck Digital Assets, LLC. The Marketing Agent for the Trust is Van Eck Securities Corporation. VanEck Digital Assets, LLC., and Van Eck Securities Corporation are
wholly-owned subsidiaries of Van Eck Associates Corporation.

2025 THE TOP ETF INNOVATORS

EXCHANGE-TRADED FUNDS
GLOSSARY OF TERMS
Master the exchange-traded funds industry terminology to
help your clients better understand the opportunities ETFs
provide. This Glossary of Terms can guide you through the
Top ETF Innovators of 2024 Guide.
Active Investing: The strategy of
trying to outperform the market by
selecting stocks, ETFs, or timing market
movements. It’s challenging and often
more challenging than it sounds.
Alpha: The performance of your
investment compared to the expected
return for its risk level. If you do better
than expected, you’ve got positive
Alpha; if worse, it’s negative Alpha.
Ask Price: The lowest price a seller is
willing to accept for their stock or ETF.
If a buyer agrees to this price, a sale
happens. Otherwise, the price may
decrease over time.
Asset Class: Different types of
investments, like stocks or bonds.
Diversification involves spreading your
investments across various asset
classes to reduce risk.
Beta: A measure of how much an
investment’s price moves compared
to the market. A beta of 1.5 means
the investment’s price moves 50%
more than the market.
Bid Price: The highest price a buyer
is willing to pay for a stock or ETF. The
price must match the asking price for
a sale to occur.
Buffer (or Defined-Outcome)
ETF: An ETF that limits your gains
in exchange for protection against
losses, often in return for a fee.
Cap Size (Market Capitalization):
The total value of a company’s shares
of stock. It helps classify companies
into large, mid, or small caps based
on their total market value.

Closed-End Fund (CEF): An
investment fund with a fixed number
of shares that doesn’t regularly issue
new shares or redeem existing ones,
possibly leading to price deviations
from the net asset value.
Closet Index Fund: A fund that
charges like an actively managed fund
but follows an index closely, not truly
justifying its higher fees.
Correlation: Measures how two
investments move in relation to each
other. A perfect positive correlation
(1) means they move identically, a
perfect negative correlation (-1) means
they move in opposite directions,
and no correlation (0) indicates their
movements are unrelated.
Diversification: Spreading
investments across various asset
classes to minimize risk. It’s a
fundamental strategy to protect your
portfolio from significant losses.
EAFE Index: This index represents
large-cap stocks from developed
countries in Europe, Australia, and the
Far East, often used as a benchmark
for international stocks.
Emerging Markets: Countries with
developing economies that offer high
growth potential but come with higher
Expense Ratio: The annual fee
charged by ETFs or mutual funds,
expressed as a percentage of the
fund’s assets. Lower expense ratios
mean more of your money is invested
rather than spent on fees.

32

Exposure: In the context of investing,
exposure refers to the degree to which
an investor is invested in a particular
asset, asset class, or market. It
indicates the potential risk and returns
from that investment. High exposure
to a specific market or sector means
that an investor’s portfolio could
significantly gain or lose value based
on the performance of that market or
sector. Managing exposure is key to
diversification, aiming to balance risk
and reward by spreading investments
across various assets or markets.
Fundamental Analysis: The
assessment of a company’s financial
health and prospects through its
financial statements, to decide on
the attractiveness of its stock as an
investment.
Growth Fund: Focuses on
companies expected to grow at an
above-average rate compared to their
industry or the overall market, though
these stocks may be more volatile.
Hedging: Reducing risk by making
investments that are expected to
move in the opposite direction of your
main investments. It’s like insurance
against market movements.
Indexing: Investing in a portfolio
designed to replicate the performance
of a market index. It’s a form of
passive investing that usually incurs
lower fees and taxes.
iShares: A brand of ETFs managed
by BlackRock, one of the largest
providers of ETFs globally, known for
a wide range of investment options.
Leverage: Using borrowed money
to increase the potential return on an
investment. While it can amplify gains,
it also increases the risk of losses.
Liquidity: The ease with which an
asset can be converted into cash
without significantly affecting its price.
High liquidity means you can quickly
sell the asset at a fair price.

2025 THE TOP ETF INNOVATORS
Load: A sales charge or commission
paid when buying or selling certain
mutual funds, which does not apply to
ETFs.
Long Position: Buying securities with
the expectation that their price will rise
over time, allowing you to sell them at
a profit later.
Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT): A
strategy that emphasizes the benefits
of diversification. You can create a
portfolio of investments with lower
risk than individual investments by
choosing assets that don’t move in
the same direction.
Passive Investing: Buying and holding
a portfolio of stocks or ETFs that track
an index, believing that over time, this
strategy will outperform active trading.
It’s less expensive and often results in
better long-term returns.
Price/Earnings (P/E) Ratio: A metric
to evaluate a company’s stock price
relative to its earnings. A high P/E
ratio might indicate a growth stock,
while a low P/E ratio could suggest a
value stock.
Qubes: A colloquial term for the
ETF that tracks the NASDAQ-100
Index, representing 100 of the largest
nonfinancial companies on the
NASDAQ stock market.
R squared (R²): Shows how much of
a fund’s movements can be explained
by movements in its benchmark index.
A higher R² indicates a closer match
to the index.
REIT (real estate investment trust):
An investment in real estate companies
or properties that pays dividends.
REITs can be more sensitive to interest
rate changes but offer a different risk/
return profile than stocks or bonds.
Risk: In investing, risk is typically seen
as the volatility or the degree to which
an asset’s price can change. High risk
is associated with greater potential
returns and more significant potential
losses.

Sector Investing: Focusing your
investments in specific sectors of
the economy, like technology or
healthcare, believing these sectors will
outperform others.

Tax-Loss Harvesting: Selling
securities at a loss to offset capital
gains taxes. This strategy can lower
your tax bill while allowing you to
reinvest in similar assets.

Sharpe Ratio: A measure of the
return an investment provides relative
to its risk. Higher Sharpe ratios
indicate better risk-adjusted returns.

Technical Analysis: Using historical
market data and charts to predict future
price movements. While popular, its
effectiveness is widely debated.

Short Position: Borrowing a stock or
security and selling it with the plan to
repurchase it later at a lower price. This
strategy profits from declining prices.

Ticker: A unique series of letters
assigned to a stock, mutual fund, or
ETF for identification. It’s used when
trading on stock exchanges.

Sophisticated Investor: This is not
just someone who trades frequently
or uses complex strategies but also
an investor who achieves long-term
success through a well-diversified, lowcost portfolio, often including ETFs.

Transparency: The ease with which
investors can see an investment’s
underlying assets or holdings, like
an ETF. This visibility can influence
investment decisions.

SPDRs: A series of ETFs provided by
State Street Global Advisors, known
for their wide range of investment
options and significant presence in the
ETF market.
Spread: The difference between the
buying price (ask) and the selling price
(bid) of a stock or ETF. A narrower
spread indicates a more liquid market.
Standard Deviation: A statistical
measure of the range of an
investment’s returns. A higher
standard deviation indicates more
volatility and, therefore, higher risk.
Style Investing: Allocating investments
according to certain characteristics, like
size (large-cap, small-cap) or investment
approach (value, growth), to achieve
diversification.

Turnover: The rate at which a
fund buys and sells its assets. High
turnover can lead to higher transaction
costs and tax liabilities for investors.
Value Fund: An investment fund
focusing on stocks considered
undervalued in price and poised for
growth. These funds aim to buy low
and sell high.
Value Premium: The historical
observation that stocks with lower
price-to-earnings ratios have
outperformed those with higher ratios
over long periods.
Volatility: The extent to which the
price of an asset fluctuates over
time. High volatility means large price
swings, which can lead to higher
returns or more significant losses.

Style Drift: Occurs when a fund
manager deviates from the fund’s
stated investment strategy, potentially
altering its risk and return profile.

Yield: The income return on an
investment, such as dividends or
interest, expressed as a percentage
of the investment’s cost or current
market value.

Tax Efficiency: A characteristic
of investments that minimize tax
payments, allowing investors to keep
more of their returns. ETFs are often
more tax-efficient than mutual funds.

YTD (Year-To-Date): The return on
investment from the beginning of the
current calendar year to the current
date. It reflects the investment’s
performance over this period.
